# scaffolder
A comparative genome scaffolding tool 

Scaffolder scaffolds a genome using an existing high quality genome as the reference. It aligns the two genomes using MUMmer and then orders and orients the contigs in the candidate genome guided by their alignments to the reference genome. 

What is needed?
A reference genome fasta file, a genome that will be scaffolded, a working MUMmer installation.
